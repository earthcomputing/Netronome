# The Basic P4 NFP NIC

This basic NIC lab is the first step and the building block for the more advanced P4 labs. Here we will create a simple NFP NIC implementation in Programmer Studio with P4, and touch on more advanced actions such as metering and load balancing.

The final solution to the lab is also provided for reference:
- p4lab1_lb_metering.p4
- p4rules_complete.p4cfg
