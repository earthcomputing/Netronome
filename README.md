# Netronome
Netronome SDK and Firmware code

This directory contains Netronome SDK (original) and Earth Computing code for NFP chip.
Two lib files nfp-sdk-sim-6.0.1/lib/libchip_model_b0.so and nfp-sdk-sim-6.0.1/lib/libchip_model_b0.so are too large for github,
 so not saved. Those files can be found in Dropbox -> Earth Computing Team Folder/nfp-sim-601lib/  directory. 
 If you need to run the simulator, you need to copy those files to the lib dir.
