When neither case is true, writes to this register have no affect, so this bit acts as a semaphore.  A process may attempt to acquire this resource by writing this bit to zero and the target field as desired.  If the write succeeds reading this register will return what was written, if not then no action is needed beyond trying again later.  To release the resource write this bit to one.",
